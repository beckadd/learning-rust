# Structs

- A type that is composed of other types
- The pieces of a struct can be of different types
- Structs are more flexible than tuples;
- come in three "flavors"
    - Classic
        - Most common
        - Each field has a name and type
    - Tuples
        - Similar to classic struct;
        - fields have no names
    - Unit
        - has no fields
        - similar to the () unit type


To instantiate a struct, we provide it with key:value pairs according to the needs of the struct
